          <p>Hobbies</p>
          My favourite hobby is Gaming. I enjoy Gaming when I am free.<br> I
          started to do it when I was still young. The first time I did it, I felt interested. So I
          kept Gaming.<br> The competition in the gaming industry always taught me to go hard practice. <br>I was happy
          when I knock out friends out  with a happy brutality or fatality ending.<br> I was thrilled when I finally laid my hands on Mortal Kombat.<br>
          I enjoy Gaming because I like to explore the imaginative world of my
          favourite Gaming star Sonic Fox.<br> There are a lot of
          advantages of Gaming. Gaming can make you, me relaxed and calm.<br> You also learn new moves and tactics which give you an upper hand.<br> Then you can further your gaming expertise in tournaments.<br> Moreover, it can give you an upper edge in thinking fast, so you can predict your next move to your opponents.<br>Which can help you out in day life scenarios. You also get to learn the different
          gaming cultures and customs of friends, gamers.<br>Favourite games.

         <p>INTERESTS</p>
          I am a cybersec Enthusist, I love the cybersecurity industry, <br> because with the current rise of cybercrime each and every day it poses as a challenge to both individuals and business firms to always be prepared to counter attack breachs and data loses.
